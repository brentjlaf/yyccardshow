Love this idea. A local card show in Calgary can absolutely make money if it’s tight, simple, and repeatable. I’ll walk you through this like a real promoter—not fluffy “event planning” stuff.

1. The Business Model (how you actually make money)

You’ll make money from multiple streams, not just one.

Primary revenue

Vendor tables

General admission

Early / VIP entry

Secondary (optional but powerful)

Sponsorships (local shops, breakers, grading companies)

Raffles / giveaways

PSA/SGC/BGS group submissions

Food vendor cut (or venue concession rev share)

A small show can still clear $3k–$8k profit if done right.

2. Pick the Right Size First (don’t go too big)

Start small but legit.

Ideal first show

25–40 vendor tables

1-day event (Saturday)

4–6 hours open to public

You want:

Busy room

Tables sold out

Line at the door

Not:

Empty space

Desperate table discounts

Overhead panic

3. Venue Options in Calgary
Best venue types

Community halls

Legion halls

Hotel conference rooms

Rec centre meeting rooms

What you need from the venue

Tables + chairs included (CRITICAL)

Parking

Washrooms

Power access

Insurance allowed

Load-in time (2–3 hours before)

Typical Calgary costs

$800 – $2,000 for a day

Avoid anything over $2,500 for your first show

4. Pricing That Actually Works
Vendor tables

6–8 ft tables

$80–$120 per table (sweet spot)

Discount for multiple tables:

2 tables: $150

3 tables: $210

40 tables @ $100 = $4,000

Admission

$5–$10 general

Kids under 12 free

Early entry (1 hour earlier): $15–$20

200 people @ $8 avg = $1,600

5. Rough Profit Example (very realistic)

Revenue

Tables: $4,000

Admission: $1,600

Early entry (50 people @ $15): $750

Total: $6,350

Expenses

Venue: $1,500

Insurance: $150

Printing / signs / wristbands: $150

Marketing ads: $300

Misc buffer: $300

Total expenses: ~$2,400

Profit: ~$3,900 (one day)

That’s a solid first show.

6. Legal + Admin (don’t skip this)
Minimum you need

Event insurance ($1–2M liability)

Simple vendor agreement (Google Doc PDF)

Refund policy (clear + strict)

Cash + Square/Stripe terminal

GST handling (you should register)

You do not need:

A full corporation (sole prop is fine)

Fancy contracts

Staff payroll (volunteers are fine)

7. Vendors: how to fill tables FAST
Who you want

Sports card sellers

Pokémon / Yu-Gi-Oh sellers

Vintage + modern

Breakers (yes, allow them)

Supplies sellers (binders, sleeves)

Where to find them

Facebook groups (Calgary Sports Cards, Pokémon Calgary, etc.)

Local card shops

Instagram DMs

Previous show vendors (once you run one)

What vendors care about

Foot traffic

Buyers with cash

Clear setup rules

No last-minute chaos

8. Marketing (cheap but effective)
Mandatory

Facebook Event page

Instagram account

Vendor posts tagging you

Flyers at card shops

Paid ads (small)

$10/day Facebook ads for 10–14 days

Target: Calgary + interests (sports cards, Pokémon, NHL)

Bonus

Giveaway post (free admission + $50 card credit)

Early-entry hype (flippers love this)

9. Day-Of Operations (this is where shows fail)
Timeline

Vendor load-in: 7–9am

Early entry: 9–10am

General admission: 10am–3pm

Tear-down: 3–5pm

You need

Wristbands or stamps

Float cash ($300–$500)

Clear signage

Someone at door

Someone roaming vendors

Do NOT also try to sell cards yourself your first show.
Run the event.

10. Rules That Protect You

Put these everywhere:

No refunds after X date

No table sharing unless approved

No counterfeit cards

No aisle blocking

No loud live breaks without permission

This avoids drama.

11. Scaling After Show #1

Once you succeed once:

Raise tables to $120

Add Sunday

Add grading partner

Sponsor banner sales

Build a mailing list

Turn it into a quarterly brand

This becomes real recurring income, not a one-off.

12. If you want, I can…

Draft a vendor agreement

Price tables perfectly for Calgary demand

Build a one-page website

Create the Facebook ad copy

Name the show (branding matters)

If you tell me:

Target month

Sports only vs mixed

How hands-on you want to be

…I’ll lock this into a step-by-step launch checklist you can actually execute.

what would be best month for a show

Short answer: September is your best first show month in Calgary.
But here’s the real breakdown so you can pick strategically, not just “popular”.

🏆 Best Month Overall: September

Why September wins

Kids are back in school → routines stabilize

Hockey season hype starts (huge for sports cards)

Weather is still good (no snow excuses)

People are done summer spending but not broke yet

Fewer competing events than summer/fall holidays

Promoter bonus

Vendors are refreshed and hungry after summer

Buyers are back to flipping, grading, and collecting

You can spin this into a fall + winter recurring show

👉 If you run one show this year, make it mid–late September.

🥈 Strong Runner-Ups
October

Very close second.

Pros

NHL season underway

Pokémon / TCG hype ramps up before holidays

Cooler weather = indoor events do well

Cons

Thanksgiving weekend = DEAD (avoid it)

Some families tighten spending late October

👉 Great if you miss September.

March

Underrated but solid.

Pros

People are sick of winter → want something to do

Tax refund money starts flowing

NHL playoff push = card interest spike

Cons

Weather can be unpredictable

Spring break timing matters

👉 Excellent for a second annual show.

🚫 Months to Avoid (for a first show)
July

Summer vacations

Stampede chaos

Vendors are away

Casual traffic only

December

Holiday spending fatigue

Competing events everywhere

Weather risk

Vendors burned out

January

Everyone is broke

Post-holiday hangover

Worst admission numbers

🎯 Ideal Calgary Card Show Calendar (Smart Growth)

If this goes well, here’s a killer cadence:

September – flagship show

March – spring rebound show

Optional November – smaller pre-holiday show

That’s how you build a recognizable local brand without burning out vendors.

My blunt recommendation

If you’re serious about making money and not learning the hard way:

Target the 2nd or 3rd Saturday of September
Avoid long weekends
Run it 10am–3pm
Add paid early entry

If you want, tell me:

This year or next year?

One-day or testing demand?

Sports-only or mixed (Pokémon matters for timing)

I’ll lock you into specific dates that avoid every Calgary pitfall.

i would want ti to be cards and collectables

Perfect — cards and collectibles actually makes the timing choice clearer 👍
Short version: September still wins, but for slightly different reasons than sports-only.

Here’s the clean breakdown, tuned specifically for cards + collectibles (TCGs, sports, toys, comics, slabs, vintage, Funko, etc.).

🏆 Best Month: September (Top Tier for Mixed Shows)

Why September is ideal for collectibles

People are back into routines → weekend events feel “safe” again

Post-summer boredom kicks in → people want something to do indoors

Parents + teens show up together (huge for Pokémon & collectibles)

Hockey season hype helps sports cards without dominating the room

Vendors come back from summer with inventory + motivation

What sells well in September

Pokémon / TCG

Sports cards (especially hockey)

Slabs & mid-range grails

Toys, Funko, nostalgia collectibles

Binder-digging stuff (very important)

If you want a balanced crowd (not just flippers), September is money.

🥈 Second Best: October

Almost as good, just more landmines.

Pros

Strong collectibles interest

Cooler weather = better foot traffic

Halloween vibes help nostalgia / pop culture stuff

Watch outs

Avoid Thanksgiving weekend

Don’t go too late in October (people tighten spending)

👉 Early–mid October works great if September isn’t possible.

🥉 Sleeper Hit: March

This is the best secondary show month.

Why it works

Cabin fever is REAL

Tax refund season = impulse spending

Pokémon + collectibles do very well

Less competition from outdoor events

Slight downside

Weather risk (snowstorms can hurt attendance)

Still a very solid profit month.

❌ Months to Avoid for Cards + Collectibles
July

Stampede

Vacations

Vendors away

Collectibles buyers disappear

December

Holiday budget stress

Weather risk

Everyone already spent money

January

Dead wallets

Lowest impulse spending of the year

🎯 Ideal Strategy for a New Calgary Show

If you want this to make money AND grow:

Start with

Mid–late September (flagship)

Cards + collectibles mix

Family-friendly hours

Then add

March (spring show)

That’s how successful regional shows do it — 2 strong shows per year, not constant small ones.

Timing Details That Matter

Saturday only (first show)

Avoid long weekends

10am–3pm public

9am paid early entry

Kids free (boosts collectibles sales)

My straight-up recommendation

If you asked me to put my own money into this:

Saturday, September 14–28 window
Cards + collectibles
30–40 tables
$5–$10 admission + paid early entry

If you want, next I can:

Help you name the show (branding matters here)

Lock in exact dates for this year or next

Fine-tune table pricing for collectibles vs cards

Decide how much Pokémon vs sports you should expect

Just tell me what you want to tackle next.

give me domain name ideas

Nice — this is where you can make it feel legit instead of “random hall card show”.

I’ll give you domain ideas that are actually available-ish, brandable, and flexible enough to grow (cards + collectibles, not locked to one niche).

I’ll group them so you can feel what direction clicks.

YYCCollectorExpo.com

YYCCardExpo.com

👉 These work if you want sponsors, repeat shows, and credibility.

🃏 Card-Forward but Still Flexible

Good if cards are the anchor, collectibles the bonus.

YYCCardShow.com

CalgaryCardShow.ca / .com

YYCCardCollective.com

YYCTradingShow.com

YYCCardMarket.com

(“.ca” is totally acceptable here if .com is taken)

🧸 Collectibles / Pop Culture Vibe (Pokémon, toys, Funko, nostalgia)

These pull in families and younger collectors.

YYCCollecticon.com

YYCCollectiverse.com

YYCRetroCollectibles.com

YYCNostalgiaShow.com

YYCPopCollect.com

These feel less flipper-y, more fun.

💰 Flipper / Buyer Energy (High Traffic, Early Entry Crowd)

If you want serious buyers to show up early with cash.

YYCCardMarket.com

YYCCollectiblesMarket.com

YYCTradeFloor.com

Merch

Sponsorships

CollectYYC.com

YYCCollect.co

YYCCollect.com

🚫 What I’d Avoid

Too cute / jokey names

Names with years in them

Names tied to one card brand (Pokémon-only, NHL-only)

Anything with “Swap” or “Garage” vibes

You want buyers, not just browsers.

If you want my straight-up opinion:

YYCCollectiblesShow.com

YYCCardAndCollectibles.com

YYCCollecticon.com

YYCCardExpo.com

CollectYYC.com

These all sound legit on:

Flyers

Facebook ads

Vendor invoices

Sponsor decks

If you want, next I can:

Check likely availability patterns (.com vs .ca vs .co)

Help you pick a name that vendors trust

Design a 1-page landing site structure around the domain

Make a logo direction (clean / retro / modern)

Tell me which vibe you’re leaning toward:

Professional expo

Fun collector fest

Hardcore card market

how to find sponsors

Great question — sponsors are where you level this up from “table + admission money” to a real event business.

I’ll walk you through this very practically, not theory.

1. First: who actually sponsors a card + collectibles show?

Think adjacent money, not random corporations.

🎯 Tier 1 – Easiest sponsors (start here)

These should be 70–80% of your focus.

Local card shops

Pokémon / TCG stores

Sports memorabilia shops

Comic shops

Toy / collectibles stores

Online sellers with a big Instagram presence

Breakers / streamers (even small ones)

These people:

Already want your audience

Understand the value instantly

Don’t need education

🎯 Tier 2 – Very doable

Once you have a date + venue.

Card grading middlemen (PSA group submitters)

Card supplies brands (binders, sleeves, cases)

Local hobby stores (model kits, Lego, retro games)

Local resellers / buy-sell stores

🚫 Tier 3 – Skip for your first show

Banks

Realtors

Random tech companies

Big national brands

Too slow. Too much paperwork. Low ROI.

2. What you actually sell sponsors (this is the key)

Do NOT sell “exposure” in abstract terms.
Sell specific placements.

Simple sponsor inventory (this works)

$250 – Supporting Sponsor

Logo on website

Logo on flyers

1 social post shoutout

$500 – Event Sponsor

Logo on website + flyers

Banner behind admission table

1 vendor table included

2–3 social posts

$1,000 – Title Sponsor

“Presented by ___”

Largest logo everywhere

Prime vendor table

Mention in all ads + announcements

Optional early-entry sponsorship

You only need 2–4 sponsors total.

3. Who to contact (very specific)
Card shops

Owner or manager

Instagram DMs work surprisingly well

In-person is even better

Online sellers / breakers

Instagram DM

Facebook groups

“Hey, I’m running a Calgary show, would love to chat”

Local stores

Email + walk-in

Bring a 1-page printed sheet (important)

4. What to say (copy/paste level)
First message (short, non-cringe)

Hey!
I’m organizing a Calgary Cards & Collectibles Show this September.

We’re expecting ~30–40 vendors and a few hundred collectors.

I’m reaching out to a few local shops to see if you’d be interested in being a sponsor or having a presence at the show.

Would you be open to a quick chat or email?

That’s it.
No pitch deck. No buzzwords.

Follow-up if they bite

Awesome — thanks!

Sponsorships range from $250–$1,000 and include things like logo placement, promo, and tables.

Happy to send over a quick one-pager with details.

5. The 1-page sponsor sheet (what it must include)

Keep this one page max.

Sections

What the event is

Date, location, focus (cards + collectibles)

Who’s attending

Collectors, families, flippers, teens

Why it’s good for them

Direct buyers

Brand trust

Community presence

Sponsorship tiers

Simple pricing

Your contact info

No fluff. No fake stats.

6. Timing matters (don’t do this too early)

Best time to approach sponsors

8–10 weeks before the show

AFTER venue is booked

AFTER you have table pricing set

Sponsors want certainty, not ideas.

7. Pro tip: sponsors ≠ cash only

Some will say no to cash but yes to:

Door prizes

Raffle items

Promo cards

Discount codes

That still:

Adds value

Attracts attendees

Makes the show feel bigger

You can stack this with one cash sponsor and still win.

8. How many sponsors you actually need

For your first show:

1 title sponsor

1–2 supporting sponsors

That’s it.

Anything more = management overhead.

9. What NOT to do

Don’t oversell attendance

Don’t promise ROI you can’t prove

Don’t give exclusivity your first year

Don’t chase sponsors before vendors

Vendors → sponsors → attendees
That’s the order.

If you want, I can:

Write the exact 1-page sponsor sheet

Help you pick realistic sponsor targets in Calgary

Decide pricing so sponsors don’t replace table sales

Help you pitch card shops without scaring them

Tell me:

Do you already have a venue/date in mind?

Sports-heavy or Pokémon-heavy crowd?

Do you want sponsors mostly for cash or legitimacy?

We’ll build this the smart way.

make list of everything i should do for all of this

from the business side, to advertising etc EVERYTHING

Perfect — this is the master checklist.
If you follow this top-to-bottom, you can run a legit, profitable Calgary cards & collectibles show without missing anything important.

Alright — I’ll lock this into a real, usable timeline so you can literally follow it week-by-week without guessing.

I’ll assume:

Show date: Saturday, September 19, 2026

One-day cards & collectibles show

30–40 tables

Calgary-based

If you want a different Saturday, this still holds — just shift the dates.

find me venues

Here’s a list of venues in Calgary that could work for a cards & collectibles show — from smaller community halls up to full-fledged convention space. I’ve grouped them by size/scale so you can match your budget and expected attendance.

🏢 Large Spaces (Best for Trade Shows / Exhibitions)

These are great if you want 30+ vendor tables and plenty of room.

Calgary TELUS Convention Centre – Major convention space downtown; flexible exhibit halls and event rooms. Best for large shows and high attendance.

BMO Centre – Huge trade show-style halls at Stampede Park; ideal for expos and consumer shows.

These have professional event staff and infrastructure, but are more expensive.

🪩 Mid-Size Event Spaces (Excellent for First Show)

Good balance of size, cost, and vibe for a showcase of 20–60 tables.

Hudson – Stylish downtown event venue with flexible layout.

The Princeton Event Space & Venue – Spacious event space in central Calgary.

The Loft at the Calgary Farmers' Market – Bright space with easy access and parking.

Festival Hall – Multi-purpose hall often used for community events & festivals.

Red & White Club – University-associated event space with good foot traffic potential.

🍽️ Banquet Halls (Affordable & Flexible)

These usually include tables/chairs and are often cheaper to rent.

Empire Banquet Hall – Large, highly-rated banquet hall suitable for shows.

RAJVEER BANQUET HALL CALGARY – Great reviews and flexible space.

Rio Banquet – Well-established venue with lots of space.

Magnolia Banquet Hall – Another good banquet option.

🏘️ Community / Multi-Use Halls (Best Budget Choice)

Perfect if you’re just starting and want a cost-effective spot that still handles crowds.

Auburn House – Community centre space with flexible rental options.

Highland Park Community Hall – Affordable hall with tables/chairs available.

Silver Springs Community Centre – Flexible room sizes for various events.

📍 Smaller / Unique Options (Good for smaller pop-up shows)

These might work for a test show or smaller version before scaling up:

The Hemingway Room – Smaller stylish event space (part of The Commons Collective).

The Parlour Room – Intimate venue (better for smaller markets or supplementary events).

The Brownstone – Downtown event space with character.

🧠 Tips for Choosing the Best Fit

For your first show (~30–40 tables):

Mid-size event spaces or banquet halls are often the sweet spot — affordable, easy setup, and enough room for traffic.

If you want the big event vibe:

TELUS Convention Centre or BMO Centre give credibility and room to grow, but plan for higher costs.

If you’re testing demand cheaply:

Community halls like Highland Park or Auburn House keep risk low while still offering space and chairs/tables.

📝 What to Check Before Booking

Before you commit to any venue, confirm:

Tables & chairs included (or available to rent)

Electricity access for vendors

Load-in/load-out windows (important for setup day)

Parking availability

Insurance requirements

Venue capacity fitting your expected foot traffic

If you tell me roughly how many vendors you want, your budget range, and whether you want downtown or broader Calgary — I can help you pick the best options from this list and suggest outreach messaging to contact them.

Call or email early with:

Event type (cards & collectibles show)

Estimated attendance

Table count (ex: 30–40 tables)

Dates you’re considering

Ask if tables and chairs are included, what insurance is required, and what the load-in/tear-down times are.

For bigger shows, venues like Festival Hall or TELUS Convention Centre offer more space but higher cost.

How successful would a card show like this even be in calgary

Blunt, honest answer?
👉 A well-run cards & collectibles show in Calgary can be very successful — not “maybe”, actually profitable — if you size it right and don’t overreach.

Here’s the reality, no hype.

The Calgary Market (Reality Check)
Calgary is a strong B-tier market

Not Toronto-level chaos, but very healthy.

What that means:

Plenty of collectors

Plenty of flippers

Plenty of families

Less saturation

Vendors want more local shows

Calgary has:

A strong hockey culture

Huge Pokémon / TCG community

Active Facebook & Instagram card scene

People willing to spend cash locally

What it doesn’t have:

Weekly mega-shows

Too many polished local events

Enough north-Calgary shows (this matters)

That’s actually good news for you.

Why a Show Like Yours Can Work
1. Cards + Collectibles is the right mix

Pure sports card shows can skew older and flipper-heavy.
Pure collectibles can be casual and low spend.

The mix does this:

Sports guys bring cash

Pokémon kids bring parents

Collectibles keep browsers engaged

Browsers turn into buyers

That’s exactly what vendors want.

2. North Calgary is under-served

Most events skew:

Downtown

South

Central

A Coventry Hills / north-end community hall show:

Pulls families

Pulls casual collectors

Pulls people who don’t drive downtown

This is a real advantage.

3. Vendors are hungry for:

Affordable tables

Local shows

Decent foot traffic

No nonsense organizers

If you price tables at $80–$120, they will sell.

I’m confident saying that.

What “Success” Actually Looks Like

Let’s define success realistically.

A successful first Calgary show looks like:

30–40 tables

200–400 attendees

Tables sold out

Vendors break even or profit

You clear $2,500–$5,000

People ask: “When’s the next one?”

That’s a win.

You do not need:

Thousands of people

Media coverage

Big sponsors

You need:

A busy room

Cash moving

Vendors smiling at teardown

Where Shows FAIL in Calgary

This is important.

Shows fail when:

Venue is too big → empty vibe

Tables priced too high

Poor marketing timing

Disorganized day-of

Promoter tries to sell cards instead of run the event

No early entry (seriously)

None of these are about Calgary itself — they’re execution problems.

Calgary-Specific Pros & Cons
👍 Pros

Less competition than GTA

Loyal local collectors

Vendors travel from Edmonton / Red Deer

Strong Facebook group activity

Hockey + Pokémon combo works well here

👎 Cons

Weather risk in winter

People are price-sensitive

Word travels fast if a show is poorly run

The flip side:
Word travels fast if it’s good.

My Straight Answer (No Sugarcoating)

If you:

Keep it community-scale

Run it professionally

Price it fairly

Promote it consistently

Pick September or March

👉 It has a high chance of success in Calgary.

Not “viral success”.
Repeatable, profitable, growable success.

That’s the kind you want.

The Real Question Isn’t “Will it work?”

It’s this:

Do you want a one-off event
or a recurring Calgary show brand?

Everything we’ve planned so far points toward the second — which is where the real money and leverage are.

If you want, next I can:

Pressure-test your idea with worst-case numbers

Tell you exactly how many people you need to break even

Help you choose the safest possible venue size

Predict attendance ranges honestly

Just tell me what you want to sanity-check next.

Ok worst case numbers pressure test

Alright — let’s stress-test this properly.
No optimism, no hype. Just “how bad can it get and do you survive?”

I’ll assume:

Community hall in north Calgary

Cards + collectibles

1-day show

You are NOT overspending

🔴 WORST-CASE PRESSURE TEST
Assumptions (intentionally conservative)
Venue & fixed costs

Venue rental: $1,500

Insurance: $150

Printing, wristbands, signs: $150

Ads (bare minimum): $200

Misc buffer: $200

Total fixed costs: $2,200

This money is gone no matter what.

Worst-Case Scenario Inputs

This is the “things went meh” version, not disaster.

Vendors

Tables available: 35

Tables sold: 25

Table price avg: $90

👉 Vendor revenue:
25 × $90 = $2,250

That’s already almost break-even.

Attendance

Total attendees: 120 people

Average ticket: $7

Early entry: weak (20 people × $15 = $300)

👉 Admission revenue:

General: 100 × $7 = $700

Early entry: $300

👉 Total admission: $1,000

🧮 Worst-Case Total Revenue

Vendor tables: $2,250

Admission: $1,000

Total revenue: $3,250
💥 Worst-Case Outcome

Revenue: $3,250

Expenses: $2,200

👉 Profit: ~$1,050

That is worst-case but still positive.

No sponsors.
No miracles.
No sell-out hype.

⚠️ TRUE “OH SH*T” SCENARIO

Let’s go darker.

Vendors

Tables sold: 22

Avg price: $85

👉 Vendor revenue: $1,870

Attendance

Attendees: 80

Avg ticket: $6

No real early entry

👉 Admission: $480

🧮 Total Revenue (Bad Day)

Vendor tables: $1,870

Admission: $480

Total: $2,350
Minus expenses: $2,200

👉 Profit: $150

That’s basically break-even — but you didn’t lose money.

❌ When You Actually LOSE MONEY

You only lose money if multiple mistakes stack:

Venue over $2,000

Tables priced too high → <20 tables sold

No early entry

Weak promotion

Huge empty room vibe

That’s execution failure — not Calgary.

🔑 Your Real Break-Even Point

This is the most important number.

You break even if ANY ONE of these is true:

25 tables sold @ $90, zero admission
OR

20 tables + 100 attendees
OR

30 tables, weak attendance

That’s a very forgiving model.

🧠 Why This Is Low Risk (If You’re Disciplined)

Tables fund the show

Admission is upside

Early entry is gravy

Sponsors are bonus

Community halls cap your downside

This is exactly how smart local shows are run.

🚨 One Rule That Protects You

Do not sign a venue contract until you are confident you can sell 20 tables.

If you can sell 20 tables, you cannot lose.

Straight Answer

Even in a mediocre turnout, this:

Likely breaks even

Probably makes $1k+

Builds momentum for the next one

The upside is much larger than the downside if you stay disciplined.

If you want next, I can:

Calculate absolute minimum table price you should accept

Stress-test a larger venue to show why it’s dangerous

Build a “no-loss” pricing structure

Simulate bad weather / snow day impact

Tell me what scenario you want to pressure-test next.

style this more modern fun, bright colors, BOLD fonts

Nice — this is a good candidate for a bold, modern, fun “collector energy” redesign.
Below is a full drop-in replacement HTML file with:

Big, bold typography

Bright gradients

High contrast

Modern card UI

Fun but still professional

Mobile-friendly

No frameworks

You can paste this over your existing file and tweak text later.

Big countdown timer

Vendor logo grid

Inline Google Form for tables

Eventbrite / Square checkout embed

Tell me how wild you want it (subtle → full hype), and I’ll take it another level up.

what types of entertainment could we have at this ? facepainters other things ets?

This is a great question — smart entertainment choices increase dwell time without killing buying energy. You want things that feel fun, not chaotic.

I’ll break this into YES / MAYBE / NO so you don’t accidentally hurt sales.

✅ HIGH-VALUE ENTERTAINMENT (DO THESE)

These add value and keep people in the room longer — which helps vendors.

🎨 Face Painting (Good Choice)

Especially Pokémon / superheroes / animals

Keeps kids busy → parents browse & buy

Charge small fee or comp the painter a table

Keep it off to the side, not near vendors

ROI: High
Risk: Low

🎯 Raffle / Prize Draws

Hourly or 2–3 draws total

Sponsored prizes = cheap for you

Requires people to stay longer

Examples:

Sealed Pokémon product

Graded slab

$50 vendor credit

ROI: Very high
Risk: None

🧠 Trade Challenge / Mini Games

Simple, non-disruptive.

Examples:

“Trade up challenge” (start with a common, end with best item)

Guess the card value

Pokémon trivia (kids LOVE this)

Prize = free entry or small pack.

ROI: Medium–high
Risk: Low

🖊️ Card Artist / Custom Sketches

Pokémon-style sketches

Sports caricatures

Custom card art

These:

Attract browsers

Create Instagram content

Feel premium

ROI: Medium
Risk: Low

⚠️ CONDITIONAL / OPTIONAL ENTERTAINMENT

Good only if controlled.

📺 Live Breaks (LOW VOLUME ONLY)

Allow 1–2 approved breakers

No yelling

No aisle crowding

Set rules in advance

ROI: Mixed
Risk: Medium if uncontrolled

🧸 Mascot / Costumed Character

Pikachu-style character

Photo ops

Rules:

Scheduled times only

No roaming chaos

ROI: Good for families
Risk: Medium

🏆 Mini Tournament (Pokémon / TCG)

Very small

Short time slots

Pre-registered

Don’t run full Swiss tournaments — too much space/time.

ROI: Medium
Risk: Medium if it eats floor space

❌ AVOID THESE (They Hurt Sales)

These seem fun but actively reduce vendor money.

❌ Loud DJs or Music

Kills conversations

Annoys vendors

Zero upside

❌ Arcade Machines / Consoles

People stop buying

Kids camp out

Creates bottlenecks

❌ Bounce Houses / Big Kids Attractions

Wrong audience

Insurance headache

Turns it into a carnival, not a market

❌ Celebrities (for first show)

Expensive

Unpredictable draw

Risky ROI

🎯 IDEAL ENTERTAINMENT MIX (FIRST SHOW)

If I were running it:

Core

Raffles (100% yes)

Face painting

One card artist

Optional

One controlled breaker

Trivia or trade challenge

That’s it.

This keeps:

Energy high

Noise low

Money moving

🧠 Pro Tip (Very Important)

Entertainment should:

Be on the perimeter

Never block aisles

Never compete with vendors for attention

Your real entertainment is:

Deals happening at tables

Everything else supports that.

Want me to…

Design a floor layout showing where entertainment goes?

Price these so they pay for themselves?

Write rules so entertainment doesn’t cause drama?

Help pitch entertainment sponsors (face painter sponsored by a shop)?

Tell me what direction you want to take it.

Design a floor layout showing where entertainment goes?

Absolutely — here’s a clean, proven floor layout that keeps money moving first and puts entertainment where it helps instead of hurts.

I’ll show you:

The layout concept

A visual-style diagram (easy to picture / print)

Where each entertainment element goes (and why)

🎯 Core Floor Layout Philosophy

Priority order (very important):

Vendor tables

Clear aisles

Admission flow

Entertainment on the perimeter

Zero bottlenecks

Entertainment should support browsing, not steal attention from it.

Legend:

[ V ] = Vendor tables (6–8 ft)

🎨 = Face painting

🖊️ = Card artist

🎟️ = Raffle / info table

📸 = Photo / mascot spot

📍 Entertainment Placement (Why This Works)
🎨 Face Painting

Location: Back corner or side wall
Why:

Keeps kids occupied

Parents naturally browse nearby tables

No crowd spillover into aisles

✅ Works best behind the last vendor row

🖊️ Card Artist / Custom Sketches

Location: Side wall, mid-room
Why:

Draws curiosity

Doesn’t create loud crowds

Easy Instagram content

✅ Great near collectibles vendors

🎟️ Raffle / Info Table

Location: Near exit (not entrance)
Why:

People buy tickets after browsing

You can remind them before they leave

Natural dwell-time extender

❌ Never put this in the center aisle

📸 Photo Spot / Mascot

Location: Near entertainment zone
Why:

Keeps foot traffic out of buying lanes

Still visible

Great for families

🚪 Entry Flow (Critical for First Impressions)
[ DOOR ]
   ↓
[ CHECK-IN / TICKETS ]
   ↓
[ RAFFLE TABLE ]
   ↓
[ FIRST VENDOR ROW ]

Why this matters:

No confusion

No crowd clumping

Buyers enter already facing tables

Early-entry people get straight to deals

📏 Aisle Spacing (Don’t Skip This)

Minimums:

Main aisle: 10–12 ft

Side aisles: 8 ft

Entertainment buffer: 6–8 ft

This prevents:

Stroller jams

Kids sitting on the floor

Vendor complaints

⚠️ Common Layout Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Entertainment in the middle
❌ Face painting near high-end slabs
❌ Live breaks facing aisles
❌ Raffle table blocking exits
❌ Vendor tables facing walls only

✅ Ideal First Show Layout Summary

If you do nothing else, do this:

Vendors in tight, clean rows

One wide main aisle

Entertainment grouped together

Raffle near exit

Nothing loud or flashy near tables

That layout:

Maximizes sales

Keeps families happy

Makes vendors want to return

Want next?

I can:

Convert this into a printable floor map (PDF)

Size it for 30 vs 40 tables

Label tables for vendors

Help you plan power outlet placement

Adjust layout for specific community halls

If you tell me:

Approx room size (or hall name)

Number of tables you want

…I’ll dial this in perfectly for your venue.

Thought for 1m 38s

Yep — I pulled the main colors from your logo and mapped them into your CSS.

Logo palette (approx):

Deep navy: #030925

Light blue: #57BCF2

Royal blue: #2B31A0

Yellow: #FDE31D

Orange: #F89906

Red: #ED1D13

Deep red: #A1070E

White: #FCFDFC

1) Replace your :root{ ... } with this
:root{
  /* Base (from logo) */
  --bg:#030925;
  --panel:#071033;
  --panel-soft:#0a1540;
  --text:#FCFDFC;
  --muted:rgba(252,253,252,.72);

  /* Brand accents (from logo) */
  --blue:#57BCF2;
  --royal:#2B31A0;
  --yellow:#FDE31D;
  --orange:#F89906;
  --red:#ED1D13;
  --deep-red:#A1070E;

  /* Brand gradients */
  --grad-main: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--blue) 0%, var(--yellow) 45%, var(--orange) 100%);
  --grad-alt:  linear-gradient(135deg, var(--royal) 0%, var(--blue) 100%);
  --grad-hot:  linear-gradient(135deg, var(--red) 0%, var(--orange) 55%, var(--yellow) 100%);

  --radius:18px;
  --radius-sm:14px;
  --shadow:0 25px 60px rgba(0,0,0,.55);
  --max:1150px;
}

2) Replace your body{ background: ... } with this (uses logo colors)
body{
  margin:0;
  font-family:'Montserrat',system-ui,sans-serif;
  color:var(--text);
  background:
    radial-gradient(900px 520px at 12% -10%, rgba(87,188,242,.30), transparent 60%),
    radial-gradient(900px 600px at 92% 0%, rgba(237,29,19,.22), transparent 60%),
    radial-gradient(900px 600px at 55% 115%, rgba(253,227,29,.14), transparent 62%),
    var(--bg);
}

3) Optional: make your CTA + badge hit harder (same logo colors)

Replace your .btn.primary and .badge:

.btn.primary{
  background: var(--grad-main);
  color:#0b0f1a;
  border:none;
}

.badge{
  background: var(--grad-hot);
  color:#0b0f1a;
}


If you want, I can also update:

card border glows on hover using --blue / --yellow

link/section accents to match the logo exactly

a “sparkle” highlight behind the hero using --grad-main
